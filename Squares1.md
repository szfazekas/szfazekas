## Distinct repetitions
The most basic repetitive structure is 𝑥𝑥 called a square due to its form 𝑥𝑥=𝑥^2. A string of length 𝑛 can have $Θ(𝑛^2)$ occurrences of squares and it is known that the maximum number of primitively rooted square is Θ(nlog⁡𝑛). Fraenkel and Simpson proved that the maximum number of distinct squares in a word is bounded by twice the length of the word. They also conjectured that the upper bound is less than the length of the word. We provided upper bounds on the number of distinct repetitions of different exponents. We also introduced a graph theoretic approach to attack the problem of counting distinct squares by looking at the networks induced by their shared special positions.
