There are several models of finite automata which preserve the idea of no additional storage but introduce additional move options for certain configurations. 
These models are usually strictly more powerful than classical finite automata and recently they have been subject to intensive research, 
as can be seen at DLT, CIAA, DCFS and NCMA conferences of the last few years.
