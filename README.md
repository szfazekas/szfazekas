ðŸ”­ I am currently working on:
- [Counting repetitions](/Squares.md)           - a topic of intense study in the fields of combinatorics on words and string algorithms
- [Oritatami systems](/Oritatami.md)            - a mathematical model of the cotranscriptional folding of RNA 
- [Unconventional automata models](/Oneway.md)  - mainly simple variants of finite automata with no/few extra resources added to the classical model
