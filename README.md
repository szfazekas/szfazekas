I have been an associate professor and prior to that a lecturer at Akita University (Japan), since 2013. Before that, I was an assistant professor at the University of Nyíregyháza (Hungary) and a postdoc at Kyoto Sangyo University. I obtained my PhD in the Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics at Rovira i Virgili University (Spain) in 2010. For more details, please see my [faculty database entry](https://akitauinfo.akita-u.ac.jp/html/100000320_en.html).

🔭 Recently I have been working on:

- [Subsequence matching and analysis](/topics/Subsequence.md)            - a topic of intense study in the fields of string algorithms
 
- [Counting repetitions](/topics/Squares.md)           - a fundamental topic in the fields of combinatorics on words

- [Oritatami systems](/topics/Oritatami.md)            - a molecular computing model based on the cotranscriptional folding of RNA

- [Unconventional automata models](/topics/Oneway.md)  - mainly simple variants of finite automata with no/few extra resources added to the classical model
