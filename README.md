🔭 Recently I have been working on:
- [Counting repetitions](/Squares.md)           - a topic of intense study in the fields of combinatorics on words and string algorithms

- [Oritatami systems](/Oritatami.md)            - a molecular computing model based on the cotranscriptional folding of RNA
 <img src="/counter1kcrop.gif"  width="450" height="121">

- [Unconventional automata models](/Oneway.md)  - mainly simple variants of finite automata with no/few extra resources added to the classical model
