## Co-transciptional folding

Oritatami Systems (OS) were introduced as mathematical models for exploiting co-transcriptional RNA folding for molecular programming. The project [AUrisim](https://github.com/szfazekas/AUrisim-julia) aims to provide an easy to use and hopefully fast enough OS simulator with example systems. An earlier and discontinued [attempt](https://github.com/szfazekas/AUrisim) used the open source game engine Godot, but simulating the folding was too slow, so I changed to Julia and Pluto notebooks.

## Co-transcriptional splicing

We introduced a computational model of co-transcriptional splicing and explored its power to generate RNA sequences from a given target set
