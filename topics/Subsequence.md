Subsequences are parts of a string one obtains by deleting some of its letters. As an overly simplified summary, matching problems usually ask whether a given string is a subsequence of another, or whether a string contains a certain kind of subsequence. Analysis prbolems are similar in flavor, but ask about a given string being subsequence of a language (set of strings).

Certain mappings from strings to numbers aim to capture some of the subsequences in a string, along with the number of their distinct occurrences. The most well-known one is the Parikh vector, which mmaps a string to its histogram (vector of the number of its letters), and its generalization, the Parikh matrix mapping.
