There are several models of finite automata which preserve the idea of no additional storage but introduce additional move options for certain configurations. 
These models are usually strictly more powerful than classical finite automata and recently they have been subject to intensive research, 
as can be seen at DLT, CIAA, DCFS and NCMA conferences of the last few years.

Complexity of non-classical automata can be expressed quantitatively by the number of non-regular transitions they perform while processing inputs. I aim to generalize the concept of non-regular steps to Turing machine computations, which allows treating several stronger-than-regular models in the same framework. The key question is how much of the non-regular resources allows qualitative changes, i.e., larger classes of accepted languages. The goal is a non-regular complexity theory, where languages are classified based on the number of non-regular transitions made by their minimal machines.
