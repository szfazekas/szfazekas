## Distinct squares, runs, and other repetitions

___

The most basic repetitive structure is $xx$ called a square due to its form $xx = x^2$. A string is square-free if it contains no squares. It was shown by Thue [22,23] that there exist square-free and cube-free strings of infinite length over ternary, respectively, binary, alphabets. A string of length $n$ can have $\Theta(n^2)$ occurrences of squares (take the trivial example of a unary word), and it is known that the maximum number of primitively rooted square is $\Theta(n \log n)$ [6]. 

In [10], Fraenkel and Simpson proved that the maximum number of distinct squares in a word is bounded by twice the length of the word. They also conjectured the following, proved in 2023 by Shuo Li and Srečko Brlek [21]:

### Theorem 1. 
> The number of distinct squares in a length n word is less than n.

In the same paper, there is a construction for a lower bound of $n − O(\sqrt{n})$. Another simple lower bound construction of the same order is binary words with k occurrences of b’s and with increasing number of a’s between each pair of consecutive b's. A number of alternative proofs of the 2n upper bound are known, see, e.g., [14] or [12]. The upper
bound was first improved to $2n − \Theta(\log n)$ in [15] and then to $11n/6$ in [8] by restricting the number of double squares (positions where the rightmost occurrences of two squares start). 

For larger exponents $k$, the number of distinct powers is less than $n/(k−2)$. For cubes the bound was improved to $4n/5$ in [5]. The problem involving higher exponents has its
inspiration in the investigation of the maximum number of runs in a string. Runs are maximal repetitions whose period is less than half of their length. The bound on their number was long conjectured to be less than the string's length [18], and recently proved to be as conjectured [1].

### Theorem 2. 
> The number of runs in a length n word is less than n.

This bound was improved to $≈ 0.9482n$ in [13], indicating that the optimal upper bounds will probably differ in the cases of runs and distinct squares.
